# 👋 Federated Learning Resource-Aware Heterogeneous LoRA Allocation

## 🧪 Getting Started

### ⚙️ Environment Setup

Ensure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) installed. 

Then update `prefix: /home/yourhomepath/anaconda3/envs/env.fl` in the `environment.yml` file based on your path. 

Then activate the environment using the provided file:

```bash
conda env create --name env.fl --file=environment.yml
conda activate env.fl
```

### 🚀 Running the Code

First, set up the HuggingFace Accelerate configuration:

```bash
cp accelerate_default_config.yaml ~/.cache/huggingface/accelerate/default_config.yaml
```

Next, launch the training script for the CIFAR-100 dataset:

```bash
bash run-cifar100.sh
```
